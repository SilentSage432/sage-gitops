/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 53
 * Severity-Based Routing (Gated, Non-Autonomous)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Determine which panel is ELIGIBLE based on severity
 *  - Establish priority routing WITHOUT triggering actions
 *  - Maintain strict operator gating and non-autonomous behavior
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic execution
 *  - No UI movement, layout, or visual changes
 *  - Logic-only — fully inert without explicit activation
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized
 *  - .sage-panel-route       (now functional but non-executing)
