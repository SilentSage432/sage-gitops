/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 52
 * Panel Auto-Opening Ruleset (Gated)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Define allowed panel actions WITHOUT executing them
 *  - Prepare for controlled auto-open behavior in future phases
 *  - Maintain strict operator-level gating
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic activation
 *  - Does NOT open panels
 *  - No layout or visual changes
 *  - Fully inert without explicit class application
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized   (new — allows action, not execution)
