/**
 * UI Renaissance — Visual Phase V12
 * Cinematic Pulse Activation
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Introduce subtle, slow environmental pulse
 *  - Create a living, cinematic atmosphere
 *  - Maintain absolute restraint and focus
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - Extremely low-frequency (not noticeable consciously)
 *  - No component movement or UI displacement
 *  - Whisperer behavior remains unchanged
