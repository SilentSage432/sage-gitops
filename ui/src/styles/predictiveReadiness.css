/**
 * UI Renaissance — Phase 28
 * Predictive Readiness Layer
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Introduce pre-response visual states
 *  - Enable anticipatory UI behavior (future-controlled)
 *  - Support cognitive timing and readiness cues
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic activation
 *  - No layout or spacing changes
 *  - Purely optional styling only
