/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 55
 * Operator-Verified Execution Trigger (Request-Only)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Allow SAGE to REQUEST permission for an action
 *  - Maintain non-autonomous behavior and strict operator control
 *  - Introduce approval checkpoint before any future execution
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic activation
 *  - Does NOT execute actions
 *  - No UI or layout changes
 *  - Fully inert without explicit operator approval class
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized
 *  - .sage-panel-route
 *  - .sage-panel-eligible
 *  - .sage-panel-verify      (new — REQUEST-ONLY, no execution)
