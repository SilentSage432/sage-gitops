/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 56
 * Post-Approval Controlled Execution (Non-Autonomous)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Enable execution ONLY after explicit operator approval
 *  - Maintain strict non-autonomous behavior
 *  - Prevent accidental or cascading actions
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic triggering
 *  - Does NOT open or execute anything by itself
 *  - No UI, layout, or visual changes
 *  - Fully inert without .sage-panel-execute applied manually
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized
 *  - .sage-panel-route
 *  - .sage-panel-eligible
 *  - .sage-panel-verify
 *  - .sage-panel-execute        (new — allows execution, does NOT perform it)
