/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 58
 * Fail-Safe Containment Layer (Non-Autonomous)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Prevent cascading or chained behaviors after execution
 *  - Ensure all future actions remain isolated and scoped
 *  - Maintain strict operator control and non-autonomous design
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic containment
 *  - Does NOT trigger execution
 *  - No UI or layout changes
 *  - Fully inert without .sage-panel-contain applied manually
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized
 *  - .sage-panel-route
 *  - .sage-panel-eligible
 *  - .sage-panel-verify
 *  - .sage-panel-execute
 *  - .sage-panel-rollback
 *  - .sage-panel-contain     (new — containment permitted, NOT automatic)
