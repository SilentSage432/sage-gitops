/**
 * Autonomous Action Layer — Phase 54
 * Safety-Gated Activation Pathway (Non-Executing)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Allow a panel to be marked as ELIGIBLE without triggering
 *  - Introduce a controlled activation pathway
 *  - Maintain strict non-autonomous behavior and safety
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic activation
 *  - Does NOT open panels
 *  - No visual or layout changes
 *  - Fully inert without explicit operator-triggered class
 *
 * ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS (manual only):
 *  - .sage-auto-init
 *  - .sage-auto-regulated
 *  - .sage-auto-awakened
 *  - .sage-auto-governed
 *  - .sage-governor-elevated
 *  - .sage-state-shift-ready
 *  - .sage-state-shift-authorized
 *  - .sage-panel-route
 *  - .sage-panel-eligible      (new — flag only, no execution)
