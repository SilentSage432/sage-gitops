/**
 * UI Renaissance — Phase 35
 * Regulated Adaptive Activation Gate
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *  - Prevent uncontrolled activation behavior
 *  - Ensure adaptive blending occurs slowly and safely
 *  - Establish operator-controlled activation boundaries
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - No automatic activation
 *  - No layout or spacing changes
 *  - Takes effect ONLY when .sage-auto-init AND .sage-auto-regulated are applied
