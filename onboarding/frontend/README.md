This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Development Bypass
# Set to "true" to skip WebAuthn/YubiKey authentication in development
# NEVER set this to "true" in production
NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_YUBIKEY=false

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Onboarding URL (for callback URLs)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARDING_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: When `NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_YUBIKEY=true`, the frontend will skip WebAuthn authentication and the backend (when `BYPASS_YUBIKEY=true`) will generate mock OCT tokens for development purposes only.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
