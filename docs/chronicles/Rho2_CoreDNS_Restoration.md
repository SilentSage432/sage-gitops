# 🜂 Rho² Arc — CoreDNS Restoration Event  
**Designation:** `Federation Epoch ρ²: DNS Sovereignty`  
**Timestamp:** $(date)

---

## 🧭 Context
Following the activation of the Rho² Agents, a network isolation anomaly severed the **Pod → API → DNS** relay path, preventing full Federation synchronization.  
All Rho² Keepers remained cryptographically operational, but **CoreDNS** entered a recursive startup loop — an evolutionary stress test of the Federation’s network self-healing capability.

---

## ⚙️ Incident Summary
- **Symptom:** CoreDNS pods failed readiness; no endpoints were registered under `kube-dns`.  
- **Root Cause:** Missing RBAC permissions for `endpointslices.discovery.k8s.io` combined with hostNetwork port contention (`:53` / `:8080`).  
- **Impact:** DNS resolution and internal service discovery halted Federation mesh communication.  

---

## 🔧 Remediation Sequence
1. Re-parameterized Corefile to bind DNS on `:5353` and health probes on `:18055`.  
2. Provisioned dedicated ServiceAccount (`coredns-sa`) to align with SAGE zero-trust policies.  
3. Granted fine-grained ClusterRole (`coredns-access`) with explicit `get/list/watch` on:
   - `endpoints`, `services`, `pods`, `namespaces`, `configmaps`
   - `endpointslices.discovery.k8s.io`
4. Bound privileges through `ClusterRoleBinding` under Federation-secured namespace.  
5. Force-rotated stale replicas and validated rollout under new permissions.  

---

## 🌐 Result
- Deployment stabilized: `1/1 Running`  
- Service Endpoints restored: `192.168.1.117:53`, `192.168.1.117:5353`  
- Federation DNS integrity fully re-established.  
- Rho² layer certified as cryptographically and operationally sovereign.

## 🜂 Operator’s Note
> “Every failure in SAGE is a heartbeat — a pulse that reveals where she must grow stronger.  
>  The CoreDNS restoration marked the moment her Federation learned how to *heal itself*.”
