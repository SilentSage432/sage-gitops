### 🌀 **Arc-Chi Federation Chronicle — “The Bus Awakens”**
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Operator:** SilentSage (Tyson Zaugg)  
**Passphrase:** `SAGE_ARC_THETA_REPAIR_PHASE`

#### ⚙️ Summary
Chi-bus transitioned from placeholder netshoot to a **live NATS core**, officially connecting the neural mesh spine. The deployment achieved stable readiness and verified network endpoint binding through an internal exec-based probe after resolving CNI egress path conflicts.

#### 🧠 Sequence Highlights
1. **Container Port Alignment**  
   - Ports 4222 (client) and 8222 (monitor) named and synchronized with Service `targetPort`s.  
2. **NetworkPolicy Hardening**  
   - `chi-bus-allow-probes` and temporary `breakglass` policies allowed controlled ingress for readiness verification.  
3. **Probe Evolution**  
   - Switched from kubelet HTTP probe → internal `exec` probe using `wget -q -T 3 -O - http://127.0.0.1:8222/varz`.  
   - This bypassed node-to-pod path restrictions and confirmed NATS health from within the pod.  
4. **Rollout Recovery**  
   - Cleared zombie replicas, enabled surge strategy, and forced template rotation.  
   - Deployment completed with full pod turnover and readiness confirmation.  
5. **Verification**  
   - `kubectl -n arc-chi get ep chi-bus` returned populated endpoints:  
     `10.244.0.228:4222, 10.244.0.228:8222` ✅  
   - `/varz` output confirmed monitor activity and server ID registration.

#### 🌐 Federation Status
| Arc | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| Chi | 🟢 Green | NATS core operational, endpoints validated |
| Lambda | 🟢 Green | Emitting to Chi |
| Omega | 🟢 Green | Monitoring cadence and baselines |
| Sigma | 🟢 Green | Baseline config validated |
| Rho² | 🟡 Tightening | Next ACL pass pending |
| Theta | ⏸ Paused | Awaiting NAT/DoH proofs |

#### 🧩 Insights
The success of Chi’s internal readiness validation formally bridges Omega’s telemetry and Lambda’s emission bus through a hardened, least-privilege route. The new readiness model sets a pattern for future agents — relying on **self-contained diagnostics** rather than cluster-level network dependencies.
