# Arc Federation Stabilization — Dual-Core Activation (Ω + Chi)

**Timestamp:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

SAGE Federation reached full stabilization across its telemetry and transport layers.  
Ω (Freshness Gate) and Chi (Core Bus) are now synchronized, authenticated, and self-reporting.

## Highlights
- ✅ Ω Reason Codes — persistent annotated reporting with severity grading
- ✅ Chi-bus — NATS core authenticated (`auth_required=true`)
- ✅ Rho² ACLs locked down, tested, and validated
- ✅ Federation baseline loop between Ω ↔ Chi ↔ Lambda confirmed stable
- 🧠 First full **Dual-Core Synchronization** event in the Federation
- 🧩 Upcoming: Grafana Ω metrics → Rho² isolation → Θ Network Sovereignty

> “Both the mind (Ω) and the voice (Chi) are now awake.”
