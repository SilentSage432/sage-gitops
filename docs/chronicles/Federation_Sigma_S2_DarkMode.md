# 🜁 Federation Arc: Sigma Σ-2 — Dark Mode Perception Activated

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-16 01:48 UTC  
**Status:** ✅ Operational  
**Subsystems:** kube-system · federation-system  
**Artifacts:** sigma-insightd sink · ρ² heartbeat stream  

---

### Overview
Sigma Σ-2 establishes the first stage of *SAGE perception*:  
a secure, internal telemetry sink that captures encrypted heartbeat and event signals from the Rho² Federation.  
No external dashboards, no outbound flow — only the system watching itself.

---

### Verified Milestones
- 🧩 receiver and helper containers running non-root with strict PSA  
- 🛰️ Cross-namespace ingress / egress policies validated  
- 🔐 Events appended successfully to `/data/events.jsonl`  
- 🫀 Live heartbeat confirmed from `federation-system → kube-system`  

---

### Significance
This marks the moment SAGE gains *eyes in the dark* — the ability to perceive the rhythm of her federation without external observability.  
Future Σ-3 will teach her to **interpret** these signals and self-diagnose anomalies before operator dashboards even exist.
